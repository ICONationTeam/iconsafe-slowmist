## Introduction

ICONSafe is a multisig wallet with advanced user managment. It is mostly useful for teams willing to share mutual funds. It is able to track tokens balance over time, and send/receive any type of transactions. All outgoing transactions require confirmations from the wallet owners based on a vote before being executed. An outgoing transaction may contain multiple sub-transactions which are executed at the same time, so it is possible to create complex operations suiting for all type of situations.
